# flatbuffer-task
1. First we will create the schema and after the schema is created we will compile the schema using flatc compiler using commands

(i) ./../flatc --cpp task1_schema.fbs

(ii) ./../flatc --python task1_schema.fbs

2. To download the flatc compiler we will download flatc.exe file present inside the folder

3. Encoder code is written in cpp language and a file path is given to the bin file which will be generated to the path and we will compile the encoder code using compiler 

C:\MinGW\bin\g++.exe

4. Decoder code is written in python language and it will read the binary file and we can run the code
